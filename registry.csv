It was was founded in 2001 on the twin beliefs that promoting growth and fighting poverty in developing countries demands serious investment in infrastructure and that the level of funding required in the poorer developing countries is such that the private sector has a crucial role to play in helping to achieve this priority. If the private sector is to be attracted to invest in infrastructure projects in these countries, it will need expert and reliable encouragement and support.

Through a group of subsidiary companies (the PIDG Facilities), PIDG offers specialised financing and project development expertise. Each Facility can customise the right solution for each set of circumstances. Together, these companies are designed to get infrastructure initiatives off the ground, in countries which find investment hard to attract.","The PIDG Annual Report, Results Monitoring Handbook, Audited Financial Statements, Operating Policies and Procedures, and Funding Instruments can be found in the Resource Library on the PIDG website - http://www.pidg.org/resource-library",0,0,40,No Segmentation. ,notspecified,active,"Updated quarterly, sixty-days after quarter end."

In line with principles of transparency and accountability, Free a girl commits to publishing project data on IATI as of January 2016. More information about IATI and its objectives is available on the IATI website.

Free a Girl is first focusing on publishing data on projects receiving funding from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Data from projects with other funding sources and donors are therefore excluded from publication at this stage.  

Free a Girl adheres to the principle of ‘Open, unless…’, whereby data on project activities are excluded from publication on IATI if the information falls under one of the following categories: 

1.	Projects that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Netherlands
Free a Girl publishes all projects funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Other projects and programmes are not published in the beginning. This policy will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. 
2.	Safety and security 
If the information disclosed could reasonably pose a threat to the safety and security of any individuals, such as project beneficiaries, partner organisations, Free a Girl staff or donors, it is excluded. This could include but is not limited to, specific locations of project activities and addresses of local partner offices and so forth. 
3.	Harmful for project activities 
Information that would cause harm or jeopardise the implementation or success of project activities is not disclosed. Given the work of Free a Girl in the area of commercial sexual exploitation, this could include information, for example, about targets of future rescue raid operations or advocacy activities.  
4.	External relations
Free a girl does not publish information that may negatively affect relationships with partner organisations, donors and other key stakeholders. Partner organisations and back donors related to projects that are published on IATI are informed of Free a Girl’s policies for publishing project data and can request exclusion. 

5.	Confidentiality and privacy
Information that can be traced to an individual, constitutes an invasion of privacy, or may be confidential due to legal, commercial or contractual reasons, is not disclosed. 
6.	Cost-effectiveness 
Free a Girl does not publish data where the time or monetary costs of obtaining and publishing the data outweigh the expected social impact or public benefit. 
7.	History
Free a Girl publishes data from projects funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that commenced after 30 June 2015. Projects prior to this date and that are not funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are excluded at this stage. 

Reviews and decision-making 
A review of this exclusion policy is conducted on a quarterly basis by the programmes manager and staff, in order to keep abreast of new requirements and changes in internal policies. Decision-making regarding publication of data and exclusions is done by the programmes manager and the director, with assistance from projects staff. 

",Data input for 2015 is yet to be audited. ,NL,"Free a Girl aims to fight against the prostitution of children and forced prostitution of young people. Free a Girl focuses on the rescue, rehabilitation and reintegration of victims and providing access to justice by prosecuting traffickers and pimps. Free a Girl has projects in Asia, Brazil and the Netherlands.

Yet our experience has shown that by connecting, partnering and collaborating with all players, it is possible to reconcile social and ecological responsibilities with supply chain and market realities.

To do that, Solidaridad pioneers innovative certification schemes, establishes producer education programmes, supports good business practices, shapes national and international policy, creates new market linkages, builds knowledge-based commodity solutions and more.

We work across society and borders to challenge the causes and address the consequences of massive human rights violations. We affirm victims’ dignity, fight impunity, and promote responsive institutions to lay the foundations for peace, justice and inclusion. 

Throughout its 17-year history, ICTJ provided intense advice assistance to support truth seeking processes, including truth commissions in Timor-Leste, Peru, and Sierra Leone; provided time-critical support to criminal justice efforts in Guatemala and Argentina; led efforts to ensure victims played a role in policy deliberations in Uganda, Morocco, and Iraq; and devised a massive mapping exercises of human rights violations in Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Lebanon. More recently, ICTJ made vital contributions to the Colombian peace process, working to introduce an integrated transitional justice approach to key stakeholders that is reflected in the peace accords. ICTJ continues to play a trusted role in implementing the accords. In Tunisia, ICTJ supported the national consultation process, the drafting of the transitional justice law, and the establishment and capacity of the Truth and Dignity Commission. ICTJ’s work alongside activists in northern Uganda to help end stigma against children born of wartime rape and their mothers has resulted in a significant shift in attitudes in communities and pledges of support from international donors.

As an organization that simultaneously works directly in the field, conducts research, and informs thinking at the global policy level, we leverage our experience working in over 50 countries to articulate lessons learned, identify emerging patterns and develop innovative approaches.

“What the Arab world needs today is an educational revolution; we need a fundamental change that will fulfil every parent’s ambition to provide their child with a quality education.”

Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah, 2013

From its founding in 2013 by Her Majesty Queen Rania of Jordan, the Queen Rania Foundation (QRF) has aimed to be the premier resource on educational issues, in Jordan and around the Arab world, and to act as an incubator for new ideas and initiatives. In the firm belief that education is the foundation of economic, political and social development, QRF’s mandate has focused on identifying gaps and opportunities for developing new education programs, with the aim of influencing policy and creating educational change on the ground. QRF’s focus is perhaps best exemplified through the launch of Edraak.org an online education platform that localized open source technology developed by Harvard and MIT to reach over a million learners across the Arab world with free high quality educational material in less than 3 years.

The Middle East region is now the world’s largest producer and host of forced displacement. With the number of refugees and displaced people across the Middle East reaching almost 15 million, QRF believes it is imperative now more than ever to reinvent education from the ground up. Education must suit the needs of a shifting geopolitical landscape and a more mobile population – forced or otherwise.

Re-inventing School Education
Jordan and the Middle East region are at a critical point. Whereas others may choose to dwell on the challenges, Her Majesty has always maintained that “Pessimism doesn’t change the reality; it prolongs the status quo… Optimism and faith coupled with pragmatism change the reality”. It is imperative upon the people of Jordan and the region to embrace the current status quo as an opportunity to disrupt existing legacy systems of education, healthcare, and infrastructure. In that light, and in response to the incoming waves of refugee children in Jordan, QRF aims to position Jordan as the ideal setting to reinvent school education through an impact focused approach to learning.

Over the next 5 years, QRF will focus on a subset of public schools that are hosting both Jordanian and Syrian refugee students, combined with learners that are out of school for a number of factors. The Foundation will aim to reach 150,000 school-age students between 3 and 15 years of age with teacher-targeted localized innovative solutions that improve learner’s socio-emotional skills, numeracy, and literacy.

To successfully disrupt the education sector, it will be critical to start at the bottom of the pyramid where resources are constrained and there is an imperative to do more with less. QRF will identify and channel funding to the most suitable innovations (technological or otherwise), localize them when necessary, and run rigorous assessments for impact. The defining aspects of QRF’s approach are the focus on rigorous evaluation methods to “solve for impact” and the mixed funding approach to ensure that both public and private sector thinking can be combined to solve these critical challenges. Successful deployments will then be scaled via public-private partnerships across the Jordanian public school system. QRF will widely share the results of all of its interventions to ensure that any lessons learned are accessible to educators and learners across the globe –especially those working within developing settings and forced migration challenges.

Within its target schools, QRF will center on 5 areas for its interventions. The focus areas have been identified through a rigorous research process using internal and external experts to ensure limited resources are directed to the issues with the highest potential for impact on learning and society. The five focus areas are: improving learning outcomes for boys, creating more structured classroom pedagogy, introducing regular formative assessment, creating strong school leadership and positive culture, and raising parental awareness and engagement in the early years of a child’s life.  These focus areas will be buttressed by three crosscutting themes that have always been central to QRF’s operations and interventions: a clear understanding of the transformative power of technology (and its limitations), provision of a healthy socioemotional school climate, and finally ensuring selected interventions are readily scalable on national levels.

As a small country, with very little resources, and in a turbulent region, Jordan has always relied on the support of visionary friends and partners to help it develop into a model of stability and moderation across the region. In the same vein, QRF seeks the support of the international community and leaders in the public and private sector to help it transform Jordan into the ideal setting to catalyze education for the developing world and especially the Middle East region.

The FMS is the only women’s fund of Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay that led women’s groups and movements working to achieve long– term social change. The FMS´s missionis to mobilize financial and technical resources and strengthen organisational capacities of women's organisations in situation of most socio-economic, cultural and environmental disadvantages in Latin America and the Southern Cone, which aim to advance gender equality as the path for a just and equitable social change.

The FMS supports women’s groups and organisations and women right’s defenders to advance women’s rights and gender equality in Latin America, with focus on the southern cone sub region. It has two key mandates (i) mobilizing international and local resources and grantmaking towards women’s rights work; (ii) building social movement with capacity development towards social change. 

The FMS mobilizes resources to support women’s rights groups and organisations through direct and flexible grants from an equal and transparent partnership, based on the conviction that women have enormous potential to be agents of social change. We believe that if women and their organisations are empowered to defend their rights and access to equal opportunities to fulfill their potential, we will contribute with inclusive, participative and sustainable models of development and wellbeing at the community level. 

To ensure the realization of its mission, the FMS focuses on:  

-Empowering women’s of most disadvantaged groups decision making and political agency by both strengthening their organizing and advocacy skills and supporting the development of inclusive and democratic leaderships, respectful of diversity and multiculturality and with regional and subregional-wide visions.

- Supporting exclusively groups and organisations led and composed by women of the most disadvantaged groups in societies and fund controversial and traditionally marginalized and invisibilized issues at the community level; such as labour rights of women workers from precarious sectors like domestic and sewing workers; environmental rights of indigenous women’s rights defenders; criminalization of women’s human rights defenders and activists; LGTTTBI, among others.

-Influencing community philanthropy and development aid sectors to increase the resources available for women’s human rights initiatives. The ultimate goal is to impact the culture of philanthropy in Latin America from a sustainable, participatory and inclusive development approach with focus on raising awareness about women’s human rights; thus changing the social landscape.

However, there is a demand within Wales for there to be an identifiable Welsh response to contributing to international development and addressing emergencies.

Actions that we take in support of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) must have a benefit to Wales as well as to the developing world. This imposes limits to the range of activities we can support but at the same time ensures that our actions will be more sustainable and based on equal partnerships.

The Wales for Africa programme seeks to:

•encourage public sector placements and twinning which contribute to MDG delivery; 

•build the capacity of small Welsh International Development Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and aid the co-ordination of the sector as a whole in order to strengthen Wales’ impact on MDG delivery; 

•promote and encourage international sustainable development volunteering to the Welsh public and public sector staff; 

•work with partners to facilitate the work of diaspora communities in Wales in maximising their impact on MDG delivery in their home country;
 
•promote best practice in Fair trade and ethical procurement across the public and private sector in Wales - making Wales a beacon of fair trade and ethical procurement in Europe.

All CERF allocation and contribution data available in its internal Grant Management System (GMS) is made available through a Web API. As of January 2016, all donor contributions to CERF, starting with the inception of the grant element in 2006, are available. Data on CERF allocations (in the form of grants and loans) is currently limited to 2014 onward pending the completion of data migration from a legacy IT system to the current GMS. ",US,"The United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is one of the fastest and most effective ways to support rapid humanitarian response for people affected by natural disasters and armed conflict. CERF receives voluntary contributions year-round to provide immediate funding for life-saving humanitarian action anywhere in the world.

ERF pools contributions from donors – mainly governments, but also, foundations, companies, charities and individuals – into a single fund with a $450 million annual target.

This money is set aside for immediate use at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources.

In emergencies, humanitarian organizations apply jointly for funding. Funds are immediately released if these proposals meet CERF’s criteria, i.e. the needs are urgent and the proposed activities will save lives.

With money available immediately, relief organizations can deliver food, safe drinking water, medical supplies and other life-saving aid faster and more efficiently.

CERF allocations are designed to complement other humanitarian funding sources, such as country-based pooled funds and bilateral funding.

CERF makes money available when it is needed most: at the beginning of a crisis, when time is of the essence and it is critical that emergency relief operations get under way quickly.

But mobilizing funds can take time and as time passes, more lives are lost.
CERF helps to remedy this problem with rapid response grants, which can be approved in as little as 48 hours.

CERF provides funding to the world’s most neglected crises. When a disaster fades from the headlines, or never makes the headlines, it is much harder to raise funds. The need for help, however, is no less significant.

CERF helps to address this challenge with underfunded emergencies grants, which are disbursed twice a year for emergencies that have not attracted sufficient funding.

CERF has a loan facility of $30 million. Up to one-year loans are provided based on indication that donor funding is forthcoming.

In an average year, CERF allocates approximately $450 million to humanitarian operations in some 50 different countries. Since 2006, more than $3.7 billion has been allocated to help millions of people in 92 countries and territories across the world.

CERF funding is available to UN agencies, funds and programmes and the International Organization for Migration.

NGOs are important partners in the CERF allocation decision making processes and receive CERF funding when they carry out work for recipient organizations.

CERF is funded by voluntary contributions. Since 2006, CERF has received almost $3.8 billion from 125 UN Member States and observers, regional and local authorities, and other public and private donors. A third of CERF’s contributors have also received support from the fund.

The Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) manages CERF on behalf of the UN Secretary-General.

The ERC is supported by the CERF secretariat, which is situated within the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The CERF secretariat is responsible for ensuring that the funds are allocated properly, disbursed in a timely manner, and that use of the funds is reported appropriately and transparently.

The CERF Advisory Group provides policy guidance to the Secretary-General on the use and impact of the fund.",0,0,0,40,0,odc-by,active,Data is published as soon as it is entered in CERF's internal grant management system (GMS).

Yet our experience has shown that by connecting, partnering and collaborating with all players, it is possible to reconcile social and ecological responsibilities with supply chain and market realities.

To do that, Solidaridad pioneers innovative certification schemes, establishes producer education programmes, supports good business practices, shapes national and international policy, creates new market linkages, builds knowledge-based commodity solutions and more.

It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together.

Created in 1948, IUCN has evolved into the world’s largest and most diverse environmental network. It harnesses the experience, resources and reach of its 1,300 Member organisations and the input of some 16,000 experts. IUCN is the global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it. Our experts are organised into six commissions dedicated to species survival, environmental law, protected areas, social and economic policy, ecosystem management, and education and communication.

The ability to convene diverse stakeholders and provide the latest science, objective recommendations and on-the-ground expertise drives IUCN’s mission of informing and empowering conservation efforts worldwide. We provide a neutral forum in which governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples groups, faith-based organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges.

By facilitating these solutions, IUCN provides governments and institutions at all levels with the impetus to achieve universal goals, including on biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development, which IUCN was instrumental in defining.

Combined, our knowledge base and diverse membership make IUCN an incubator and trusted repository of best practices, conservation tools, and international guidelines and standards. As the only environmental organisation with official United Nations Observer Status, IUCN ensures that nature conservation has a voice at the highest level of international governance.

IUCN’s expertise and extensive network provide a solid foundation for a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects around the world. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people’s well-being. They also produce a wealth of data and information which feeds into IUCN’s analytical capacity.

Through their affiliation with IUCN, Member organisations are part of a democratic process, voting Resolutions which drive the global conservation agenda. They meet every four years at the IUCN World Conservation Congress to set priorities and agree on the Union’s work programme. IUCN congresses have produced several key international environmental agreements including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the World Heritage Convention, and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. We continue to help these conventions strengthen and evolve so that they can respond to emerging challenges.

Our Member organisations are represented by the IUCN Council – the governing body. Headquartered in Switzerland, IUCN Secretariat comprises around 900 staff in more than 50 countries. ",0,0,0,15,0,notspecified,active,0

Yet our experience has shown that by connecting, partnering and collaborating with all players, it is possible to reconcile social and ecological responsibilities with supply chain and market realities.

1. Introduction
Amnesty International - The Netherlands values transparency and accountability. Therefore Amnesty International - The Netherlands decided to publish its project data. Amnesty International - The Netherlands commits itself to publish its project data set compliant to the IATI standard. The first IATI compliant project data set will be published at no later than 30-04-2016. The projects that ran in the period 01-01-2016 and 30-03-2016 will be included in the data set. Amnesty International - The Netherlands embraces the principle “Open, unless…”. This means that Amnesty International - The Netherlands remains to have the right to exclude project information from publication to IATI if it falls in one of the following categories:
•	Information disclosure affecting relations between partner organization and government/other NGOs (human rights work or work in some conflict affected states);
•	Detailed specific information affecting and jeopardizing the safety and security of NGO staff, partner staff or beneficiaries;
•	Personal information of individual staff and/or partners (e.g. addresses and telephone numbers);
•	Commercially sensitive information (salaries, consultant fees);
•	Information that is exempt under data protection laws or by pre-existing organizational policies.
2. Articles
2.1 General principles for exclusion
External relations
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, authorities  or institutions of Amnesty International - The Netherlands, its partners or other donors. All partner organizations and donors
are informed on forehand about Amnesty International - The Netherlands’s policies concerning publishing project data . All the parties have the possibility to request exclusion on forehand, based on the principles in this exclusion policy. Amnesty International - The Netherlands is, at all times, the final decision-maker for the exclusion of data.
Security
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data of which it can be expected that it might pose a risk to
the safety and/or security of any individuals, local Amnesty International - The Netherlands offices, groups of beneficiaries, partner
organizations, donors or suppliers. From a security point of view it was decided to
publish transaction on a cumulative basis per quarter per activity.
Privacy
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish any information which is traceable to an individual person and that violates that person’s privacy without obtaining prior consent of that specific person involved.
Commercial/Strategic
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that might harm the commercial or strategic interests of Amnesty International - The Netherlands,
its partners, donors or suppliers. Information about the conditions and repayments of loans, investments and guarantees is part of this exclusion and will therefore not be published by Amnesty International - The Netherlands.
Legal/Contractual
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data if we do not have the right to publish the data. Amnesty International - The Netherlands will not publish the data if Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not hold the copyright on particular information or if contractual agreements with back donors or partner organizations impede Amnesty International - The Netherlands’s right to publish the data.

History
Amnesty International - The Netherlands publishes all project data of projects started after 01-01-2016  or ongoing projects
with new commitments of more than EUR 25,000 in 2016. 
Social impact
Amnesty International - The Netherlands does not publish data that possibly harms the social impact of Amnesty International - The Netherlands in general or the related project in particular.
Openness and transparency about the exclusion policy
Amnesty International - The Netherlands is transparent about the exclusion policy that Amnesty International - The Netherlands applies to its published IATI compliant data set. This policy is therefore published on the publicly accessible website of Amnesty International - The Netherlands: www.paxvoorvrede.nl.
Published activities 
Amnesty International - The Netherlands will report all its projects as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier. However, other information might not be included if one or more categories that are mentioned in this exclusion policy apply. 
Data Quality
Amnesty International - The Netherlands values the quality and consistency of its open data. Therefore Amnesty International - The Netherlands publishes only
project data that meet the minimum requirements. The data quality concerning e.g. reliability will be assessed by program officers. Data that does not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.
3. Decision-making on excluding data
Amnesty International - The Netherlands has the right to exclude data. Information will be disclosed unless a project officer decides otherwise. The responsibility for excluding information is at the level where the information can be assessed in detail. It is possible to exclude a particular project, specific information fields of the IATI standard and/or specific documents from disclosure in the project administration. 
4. Review of exclusion policy and quality of data
On a quarterly basis the planning, monitoring and evaluation department of Amnesty International - The Netherlands will review all data excluded from disclosure. It will be reviewed whether data are rightly excluded and if the exclusion policy is still valid. The exclusion policy will be reviewed and if necessary adjusted on an annual basis.",0,NL,0,0,0,0,21,0,cc-by,active,0

Our mission is to empower rural Africa to achieve economic independence - and on a continent where up to 75% of people rely on small-scale agriculture for their survival, we believe that it is only by tackling the challenges faced by rural farming communities that real and sustained economic progress can be made across sub-Saharan Africa.

For more than 25 years, Self Help Africa has sought to strengthen agricultural systems, improve access to services and inputs, and provide rural African communities with the opportunities to market and sell their produce.

Self Help Africa works with local staff and partners in nine countries, supporting communities to grow more food, diversify their farm production, develop new off-farm enterprise, and sell their surpluses.

We support rural micro-finance programmes, assist producers to organise into farmers associations and co-operatives, enable farm families to access markets and add value to their produce, and promote low-cost sustainable solutions to the management of natural resources, to community adaption to a changing climate, and to the challenges of gender inequality.

Self Help Africa is also committed to advocating in support of the interests of African smallholder farmers, to ensure that there is a long-term commitment to aid and investment, to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture and food production in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.

Self Help Africa was formed in 2008 from a merger between two like-minded charities: UK NGO Harvest Help and Irish agency Self Help Development International. Both charities were founded in mid-1980s in response to the catastrophic Ethiopian famine and the droughts that plagued many central African countries.",None available,0,0,21,No segmentation.

•	Names, contact details
•	Internal communication

Confidentiality

Sensitive advocacy initiatives
•	It may be necessary to restrict some information related to sensitive advocacy work: 
o	Where publication risks compromising the safety and security of staff, partner organisations, or beneficiary communities.
o	Where publication risks jeopardising the positive outcome of the initiative.

Governance 

•	Confidential information relating to the governance and oversight of the organisation (subject to legal reporting requirements). 

Privacy

CARE International UK was founded in 1985 and we are one of 14 full members of the global CARE International federation. 

As well as supporting CARE’s humanitarian and development work around the world, CARE International UK provides specific expertise in the areas of women’s economic empowerment, inclusive governance, humanitarian response (particularly shelter, and gender in emergencies), and engaging with the private sector. We also play a key role in CARE’s work engaging with and influencing policy-makers and decision-makers to tackle the structural causes of poverty and social injustice.

CARE’s programmes are implemented through CARE country offices which are supported with technical assistance and programme management by CARE members (including CARE International UK). We work in partnership with local organisations to deliver many of our programmes.
CARE is non-religious and non-political, allowing us to deliver humanitarian and development assistance to anyone in need regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, age, religion, political view or sexual orientation.

The updated policy will be published in 2019. For more information on our current approach to transparency please visit https://www.actionaid.org.uk/about-us/transparency.,"Pre-2018 data
As our income comes from hundreds of thousands of individual people, community groups, trusts and foundations, we have not published their names as we do not have their permission to disclose their identity and details. We therefore have anonymised the data published to the IATI registry where that’s appropriate. Furthermore our income from private individuals (committed giving) involves regular ongoing cash or direct debit payments and a large proportion of our loyal supporter base stay with us for many years. However, the IATI data format requires to enter start and end dates. Given that it is not easy to represent an ongoing income stream in IATI (and after having taken advice from IATI on how best to do this), we have stated start and end dates of 1st January and 31st December against all committed giving.

2018 data onwards
Data published to the IATI Registry follows an internal Quality Assurance (QA) process, the details of which are currently being formalised and will be published in 2019. Data on expenditure and disbursement is verified by the Finance team through AAUK's Global Finance System. Whilst past data has been verified, future budgets, planned disbursments and project narrative might change.

Sector information and Policy Markers are based on the judgement of project staff even though based on OECD/DAC guidelines.

We support organisations of persons with disabilities to hold their governments to account and advocate for change locally, nationally and internationally.

The cornerstone of our work is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD). We promote the effective and full implementation of the UN CRPD, and compliance by governments and the UN System, through the active and coordinated involvement of representative organisations of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and international levels. The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals are also integral to IDA's work to promote inclusive, sustainable development in line with the UN CRPD and the rights of persons with disabilities.

With member organisations around the world, IDA represents the estimated one billion people worldwide living with disabilities. This is the world’s largest – and most frequently overlooked – marginalised group.

Syria Relief was established in 2011 in response to the beginning of the Syrian crisis. Overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing disaster unfolding in Syria, a group of friends of Syrian heritage came together in order to provide emergency humanitarian aid, for what was initially assumed would be a short-term outreach.
We are now at the forefront of non-profit support on the ground in Syria, covering unique and critical areas, from specialist psychiatric treatment for children suffering from PTSD to prosthetic limb clinics.
We directly aid civilians and displaced communities while providing the tools and training to help them become self-sufficient.
Syria Relief has a solid network of committed management and logistics staff on the ground inside Syria – currently numbering at around 1,700. These connections mean we can deliver vital and efficient support to hard-to-reach rural and besieged areas.

WOMEN’S ACTION GROUP PROFILE

1.	Background
Women’s Action Group (WAG) was founded in 1983. It was the violation of the human rights of black women by a black government which gave birth to this organisation. WAG was formed following the arrest and incarceration of over 6 000 women from October to December 1983 under Operation Clean up and its purpose was to round up single women and charge them as prostitutes. Thousands of women were arrested and detained. It was the arbitrary arrest and denial of freedom for the women of Zimbabwe that saw a handful of ordinary women taking up the fight against injustice. Since then, WAG never looked back on advocating for women’s rights. The organisation was registered as an Educational Trust in 1987 and has gained consultative status with the United Nations’ Economic and Consultative Social Council (ECOSOC). 
1.1 Vision
WAG’s vision is a Zimbabwe with empowered women and girls claiming and enjoying their rights in a situation of transformed power relations between women and men. The core purpose of the organisation is to champion women’s rights in Zimbabwe.
1.2 Mission statement
WAG’s mission statement is to develop products and tools for unlocking women’s power to claim and enjoy their rights in violence free and rights conscious communities.  The main programme areas for WAG include HIV & AIDS, Sexual reproductive health and rights and Gender based violence. 
1.3 Core purpose
   WAG’s core purpose is to champion women’s rights in Zimbabwe.

2.	Programme thematic areas
2.1 HIV AND AIDS
The programme advocates for specific   HIV and AIDS policies that are sensitive to the needs of women and girls as well as empowering them to assert their rights to safer sex to prevent HIV infection   
Objectives 
•	To raise awareness among communities particularly women and girls on  HIV and AIDS , gender and negative cultural practices increasing women’s vulnerability to HIV and AIDS
•	To advocate for policies on HIV and AIDS, that are sensitive to the specific needs of women and that promote quality health service provision for women
•	To empower women through information sharing to assert their right to safer sex to prevent HIV infection
•	To actively participate in national, regional and international processes on HIV and AIDS and articulate the concerns of women, as part of the global response to HIV and AIDS

2.2 GENDER BASED VIOLENCE

The programme touches on all aspects of women’s lives (public and private domain). The battle to free women from violence is fought on many angles including legislative reform, legal advice, counselling and representation and awareness raising campaigns. 
Objectives
•	To increase national awareness on the negative impact of gender based violence on women and girls.
•	To empower communities  particularly women to fight and prevent gender based violence in their lives
•	To advocate for policies and laws that address gender inequalities and gender based violence
•	To contribute to international, regional and national strategies and interventions to eradicate gender based violence
2.3 SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RIGHTS  
WAG is focusing on the Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights programme to promote strategies that respect the sexual and reproductive health rights and needs of women and girls.
Objectives
•	To promote gender equality in sexual and reproductive health and rights
•	To lobby for access to quality health care services in Zimbabwe
•	To raise community awareness and encourage them to come up initiatives and strategies that promote sexual and reproductive health and rights
•	To contribute to national, regional and international strategies and interventions to promote sexual and reproductive health and rights
2.4 AREAS OF OPERATION
All the three programmes operate at community and national level. WAG engages in awareness raising campaigns and training on addressing the intersections of HIV, gender based violence and women’s rights. WAG engages communities in dialogue on issues that affect them and come up with their own initiatives and solutions that promote the enjoyment of women’s rights. 
WAG also focuses on lobbying and advocacy for gender sensitive laws and policies. The organisations also works closely with the policy makers (the women’s caucus, parliamentary portfolio on health) to ensure that they commit to the international and regional instruments on women’s rights that Zimbabwe has ratified.

3.	Technical expertise
Women’s Action Group has experience in the field of gender equality and gender-based violence programming having worked in 26 Districts under the Integrated Support Programme (ISP) on prevention of GBV. Under the same programme, WAG demonstrated its expertise in capacity building through training of Behaviour Change Facilitators (BCFs) on integrating GBV in HIV programming in 13 Districts. WAG also made an input into the GBV training manual that was developed for BCFs. WAG has also demonstrated its training expertise through multi-sectoral training in 26 ISP Districts that resulted in the development of District level referral pathways for the 26 Districts. WAG has also developed training material for other programmes on gender equality such as the training manual for Community Based Advocates under the UN Women H4+ programme and has also developed GBV training manuals for training of service providers, civil society organisations and Community Based Advocates under the Amplify Change programme. WAG also has dedicated staff who have technical expertise in gender equality programming. Of particular interest has been WAG’s contribution to national priorities and its commitment to preventing GBV as one of its key strategic objectives under the current and past organisation strategic frameworks.
One of WAG’s flagship that has been championed over the years has been the production of booklets and the Speak Out magazine which requires fluency in both English and Shona as well as writing and editorial expertise. Through the production of other materials such as training manuals, WAG has also improved their ability to write concisely and produce material that has been shared globally through the website and other media channels. 
Other key competencies 
WAG believes that with teamwork the organisation can achieve greater results as individuals have diverse expertise. WAG also has respect for diversity having worked with diverse groups of people across ethnic backgrounds and lifestyles. The current programmes on gender equality requires WAG to have the aptitude to fit in different societies with different cultures and religions such as the Tonga people, apostolic sects, sex workers and persons with disabilities while maintaining respect of their differences.  WAG also values communication as a key component in coordinating programmes and have reputable communication structures with its partners. WAG has a good track record in delivering programme objectives and this has been demonstrated through its commitment to achieving results in all programmes undertaken.

DRC fulfils its mandate by providing direct assistance to conflict-affected populations – refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs) and host communities in the conflict areas of the world; and by advocating on behalf of conflict-affected populations internationally, and in Denmark, on the basis of humanitarian principles and the Human Rights Declaration. We understand ""durable solutions"" as any means by which the situation of refugees can be permanently and satisfactorily resolved, enabling them to live normal lives. Durable solutions can be voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement. In Denmark, DRC assists refugees in all aspects of integration as well as asylum procedures. Internationally, DRC actively participates in supporting the protection of refugees, and promoting durable solutions for conflict-affected populations.

The DRC’s supreme authority is the Council, which consists of up to three representatives of each member organisation, six representatives of the voluntary groups and refugee counselling organisations cooperating with the Danish Refugee Council, and of the Executive Committee.
DRC is an umbrella organisation and is currently consisting of 30 organisation members and voluntary groups, committed to the refugee cause.

However, DRC also implements through local partners when this is the best way to meet DRC’s mandate and values. In such cases, DRC is committed to assist the implementing partner strengthen its accountability and capacity.

IhsanRD main activities are included in the five humanitarian programs:
* Food Security and Livelihood:
This program focuses on two main types of support: Emergency Aid and Sustainable Support.
Emergency Aid: Syrian communities have suffered a significant increase in violence due to the ongoing conflict, forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. Our staff members in the field quickly identify community needs and respond promptly by distributing ready-to-eat rations and food baskets, as well as by supporting local bakeries.
Sustainable Support: IhsanRD supports and sustains local agriculture by providing key resources, such as seeds, fertilizer, fuel, and additional raw materials necessary for successful farming. We conduct training on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) to educate farmers and increase our impact. This training introduces new agricultural technologies, such as “inter-cropping,” which unused land between olive groves optimizing production. 
 We also conduct programs that provide the most vulnerable households with opportunities to earn income. Through this program, households conduct rehabilitation of community assets in exchange for cash given to vulnerable families.

* Protection:
This program focuses on supporting children and victims of gender-based violence.
Child Protection: IhsanRD established several new centers in  Syrian governorates to provide children in need with improved access to quality protection resources. These centers provide structured recreational and psycho-social support, as well as case management services, to affected boys and girls. Our team also manages mobile units to provide recreational psychosocial support to children who cannot access our centers. These units generally administer services in local schools, mosques, community centers, and camps.
Gender-Based Violence: IhsanRD delivers services to victims of gender-based violence through safe spaces, which provide women and girls with a safe support network, as well as psycho-social services and vocational training. These programs enable women to find jobs in clinics, hospitals, and local organizations.

* WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE (WASH)
IhsanRD has significantly increased WASH programs in select areas in Syria to rehabilitate critical water networks and sewage systems. As part of the rehabilitation process, we perform the following activities: • Installing critical hardware, such as generators and pumps • Rehabilitating water storage units • Rehabilitating piping networks destroyed during the conflict  • Supporting operations and maintenance of WASH units in cooperation with Local Councils by providing incentives, toolkits, fuel, and chlorine • Administering technical training • We also train community members to establish cost-recovery systems, and how to collect fees from local households to ensure that communities can continue operating their water systems after IhsanRD withdraws.

* Education:
This program focuses on expanding our education efforts in order to reach more children and provide better services. Our projects include: • Rehabilitating and renovating schools • Providing material resources and guides; including Education in Emergencies and Child Safe-Guarding guides for educators • Offering technical support and incentives for teachers and administrators • Delivering kits to teachers and students • Providing heaters and fuel for schools during winter • Conducting training programs on Education in Emergencies, Teachers in Crisis Contexts, Psychosocial Support, Child Safe-Guarding, and other important topics • Organizing awareness sessions for children, based on international standards, that cover various topics, such as avoiding remnants of war, maintaining personal hygiene, and returning to the education system • Managing vocational training centers in traditional school spaces to provide youth with professional skills and to enable them to transition into the job market • Building referral mechanisms within schools to provide vulnerable children with psychological services in cooperation with Ihsan’s Protection team • Establishing safety and security plans and providing schools with safety equipment, such as fire extinguishers and first aid kits.

* NON-FOOD ITEMS & SHELTER :
This program focuses on providing life-saving assistance to families fleeing violence or facing harsh weather conditions. Displaced families lack access to basic non-food items. IhsanRD provides essential materials, such as blankets, solar lamps, and mattresses, to the most vulnerable families living in dire conditions. 
We also provide families with tents and manage local centers to support individuals with nowhere to go.
In addition, we distribute winter kits and clothing through in-kind donations and voucher programs.",n/a,All project data will be quality checked at the time of upload which is then completed by the Management & Financial Support Officer.

Since its establishment in 2013, IhsanRD has successfully implemented more than 181 projects, with total budget $101,297,141 USD in five sectors (Protection FSL, Education, NFI/Shelter, and WASH) and four projects M&E as a Third-Party Monitoring.

This Architecture change will not affect the level of data publication, but will mean a fewer number of data points. (For more information, please see http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/grantarchitecture/?lang=en).

Moreover, data found in the Data Catalog is unit-level data based on Global Fund grant information.  Data at the grant level may not be aggregated to obtain higher-level data (i.e. country or regional levels).

3501 DH Utrecht",0,0,NL-KVK-30214009,0,"1. Introduction
PAX values transparency and accountability. Therefore PAX decided to publish its project data. PAX commits itself to publish its project data set compliant to the IATI standard. The first IATI compliant project data set will be published at no later than 30-04-2016. The projects that ran in the period 01-01-2016 and 30-03-2016 will be included in the data set. PAX embraces the principle “Open, unless…”. This means that PAX remains to have the right to exclude project information from publication to IATI if it falls in one of the following categories:
•	Information disclosure affecting relations between partner organization and government/other NGOs (human rights work or work in some conflict affected states);
•	Detailed specific information affecting and jeopardizing the safety and security of NGO staff, partner staff or beneficiaries;
•	Personal information of individual staff and/or partners (e.g. addresses and telephone numbers);
•	Commercially sensitive information (salaries, consultant fees);
•	Information that is exempt under data protection laws or by pre-existing organizational policies.
2. Articles
2.1 General principles for exclusion
External relations
PAX does not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, authorities  or institutions of PAX, its partners or other donors. All partner organizations and donors
are informed on forehand about PAX’s policies concerning publishing project data . All the parties have the possibility to request exclusion on forehand, based on the principles in this exclusion policy. PAX is, at all times, the final decision-maker for the exclusion of data.
Security
PAX does not publish data of which it can be expected that it might pose a risk to
the safety and/or security of any individuals, local PAX offices, groups of beneficiaries, partner
organizations, donors or suppliers. From a security point of view it was decided to
publish transaction on a cumulative basis per quarter per activity.
Privacy
PAX does not publish any information which is traceable to an individual person and that violates that person’s privacy without obtaining prior consent of that specific person involved.
Commercial/Strategic
PAX does not publish data that might harm the commercial or strategic interests of PAX,
its partners, donors or suppliers. Information about the conditions and repayments of loans, investments and guarantees is part of this exclusion and will therefore not be published by PAX.
Legal/Contractual
PAX does not publish data if we do not have the right to publish the data. PAX will not publish the data if PAX does not hold the copyright on particular information or if contractual agreements with back donors or partner organizations impede PAX’s right to publish the data.

History
PAX publishes all project data of projects started after 01-01-2016  or ongoing projects
with new commitments of more than EUR 25,000 in 2016. 
Social impact
PAX does not publish data that possibly harms the social impact of PAX in general or the related project in particular.
Openness and transparency about the exclusion policy
PAX is transparent about the exclusion policy that PAX applies to its published IATI compliant data set. This policy is therefore published on the publicly accessible website of PAX: www.paxvoorvrede.nl.
Published activities 
PAX will report all its projects as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier. However, other information might not be included if one or more categories that are mentioned in this exclusion policy apply. 
Data Quality
PAX values the quality and consistency of its open data. Therefore PAX publishes only
project data that meet the minimum requirements. The data quality concerning e.g. reliability will be assessed by program officers. Data that does not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.
3. Decision-making on excluding data
PAX has the right to exclude data. Information will be disclosed unless a project officer decides otherwise. The responsibility for excluding information is at the level where the information can be assessed in detail. It is possible to exclude a particular project, specific information fields of the IATI standard and/or specific documents from disclosure in the project administration. 
4. Review of exclusion policy and quality of data
On a quarterly basis the planning, monitoring and evaluation department of PAX will review all data excluded from disclosure. It will be reviewed whether data are rightly excluded and if the exclusion policy is still valid. The exclusion policy will be reviewed and if necessary adjusted on an annual basis.

Within the Solidaridad Network each project is funded by one or more grant contracts. Each project and each grant contract is owned by one of the nine Solidaridad Regional Expertise Centres (RECs). This REC is accountable for the project or grant contract and thus includes it in its IATI dataset. Incoming grant contracts are allocated to projects. Outgoing funds (expenditures) are always part of a project. Both grant contracts and projects, and all the interactions between and among them are published in the IATI datasets of the four Solidaridad publishers.  ",The Solidaridad IATI Activity Files currently only include those activities (projects and grant contracts) funded or co-funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MinBuZa/DGIS).,Internal review and approval flows apply to the data of each and every project and grant contract in Solidaridad's cloud-based information system called Solidaridad Plaza. Internal (financial) control and reporting at Solidaridad Network level are conducted on a quarterly basis and external audits of all nine Solidaridad Regional Expertise Centres on an annual basis. ,NL,"Solidaridad is an international civil society organization with more than 45 years of global experience in facilitating the development of socially responsible, ecologically sound and profitable supply chains. Solidaridad works across 13 supply chains and operates through 9 regional offices on 5 continents.

Ensuring quality of life and a healthy planet for all of us requires continuous effort and mutual cooperation from all parties involved. It also means creating products and processes along supply chains that will help us transition towards a fully inclusive, sustainable economy.

There are many values, interests and agendas at play in this transition. And sometimes they conflict. Yet our experience has shown that by connecting, partnering and collaborating with all players, it is possible to reconcile social and ecological responsibilities with supply chain and market realities.

To do that, Solidaridad pioneers innovative certification schemes, establishes producer education programmes, supports good business practices, shapes national and international policy, creates new market linkages, builds knowledge-based commodity solutions and more.

Investing in structural change – like safeguarding food security, strengthening acceptable labour conditions and a living wage, creating infrastructures for responsible mining, and facilitating access to investment – is the only way to sustain positive impact on the health and livelihoods of people and the planet not just for today, but well into the future.",n/a,0,0,21,"No, the IATI data are not segmented by country or region.

In Solidaridad Plaza all nine Regional Expertise Centres (REC) of the Solidaridad Network plan, manage, and monitor their sustainable development programmes, both financially and programmatically. On a quarterly basis, the IATI datasets are gleaned from the live Solidaridad Plaza database for each of the nine RECs and published to the IATI website. While the data on Solidaridad Plaza is live, internal (financial) control and reporting at Solidaridad Network level are conducted on a quarterly basis. Thus, toward the end of each quarter, each REC ensures their data in Solidaridad Plaza are up to date and reports to the Solidaridad Network Secretariat as well as to the other RECs. This is also when the IATI datasets are published. "

The below articles describe the principles which guide Mama Cash and its partners to make decisions to publish only parts of the information or to not publish any information of the activity. Mama Cash partners can include additional principles that apply only for their individual publication of data resulting of their activities undertaken.

General principles for exclusion
1.1 External relations
Mama Cash will not publish data that might harm the relationship with local governments, local institutions, its partners, individuals or (back) donors. All stakeholders are informed upfront about the Mama Cash exclusion policy before publishing data. The stakeholders have a possibility to request exclusion, based on the principles in this exclusion policy which need to be followed up by Mama Cash. Mama Cash is, at all times, the final decision-maker for exclusion of data.
1.2 Security and safety
Mama Cash will not publish data of which it can reasonably be expected that it might pose a risk to the physical or psycological safety or security of any individuals, members of staff, groups of beneficiaries, partner organizations, (back) donors or suppliers. 
1.3 Privacy
Mama Cash will not publish any activity information (photos, names, personal information) that is traceable to an individual person and can reasonably be judged as an invasion of the privacy of that person.
1.4 Legal/Contractual
Mama Cash will not publish data if it does not have the right to publish the data or if contractual agreements with (back) donors or partner organisations impede Mama Cash’s right to publish the data.
1.5 Social Impact
Mama Cash will not publish data that possibly harm the social impact of their partners in general and/or the activity undertaken by the partner.
1.6 Operational damage
Mama Cash will not publish if sharing information on an activity (ties) could be disadvantageous to its success.
1.7 Details
Mama Cash will not publish unnecessarily detailed information such as exact dates and locations. The level of detail that can be given depends on the type of activity. Activities which are generally considered safe can be published at the national level while very sensitive activities will be published at the regional level.
1.8  Openness about the exclusion policy
Mama Cash will be transparent about the exclusion policy that it applies. This policy will therefore be published on its website. CMI! Consortium members will publish all excluded activities as separate activities mentioning an activity identifier and the total commitments for the activity.
1.9  Data Quality
Mama Cash values the quality and consistency of their open data. Therefore Mama Cash will publish only activities data that meet the minimum requirements of secure and liable information. Data that do not meet the minimum requirements will be excluded.
2.0 Financal data
Mama Cash will publish financial data annually as the costs for publishing/obtaining the data are too high in relation to the relevance of the data for the public. 
",0,NL,"Mama Cash is dedicated to advancing and defending the human rights of women, girls and trans people worldwide.

Our goal is to contribute to strong feminist groups and movements that organise together to end inequality and injustice.

This was a huge achievements for the ex bonded labour who were deprived of their rights and entitlements under various alibis for ages. Unfortunately, the lack of effective implementation of the commitment has remained a major challenge and as a result the great majority of ex bonded labour continue to suffer with no sign of relenting. Hence, the project jointly has implemented by the BASE as lead applicant and WVAF as partner organization have envisioned ameliorating the situation that has remained a long overdue.

unitedstates,United States,"Based on the schedule and coverage rates elaborated above, regular quarterly data publication will commence in 2013 for a subset of total ODA, with 100% of ODA reporting expected by the end of 2015.  
Verified, complete, annual statistical data and information on U.S. Government ODA flows will be published in the IATI format at the end of each calendar year once OECD/DAC reporting is complete.  ",not_specified,0,Data published in the IATI format will be available at ForeignAssistance.gov. ,See the U.S. Government’s IATI Implementation Schedule which is posted on IATI’s website (www.aidtransparency.net/implementation) and on the Foreign Assistance Dashboard (ForeignAssistance.gov).,Foreign Assistance Dashboard (ForeignAssistanceWeb@state.gov),0,0,US-USAGOV,"For the United States, each record (row or data entry) is an activity.  The U.S. reporting does not have a multi-tiered project structure.","It is the policy of the U.S. Government, per OMB Bulletin 12-01 (/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/fy2012/b12-01.pdf), for agencies to have a strong presumption in favor of openness.  The guidance does provide the following principled exceptions:

a) When public disclosure threatens national security interests; b) When public disclosure is likely to jeopardize the personal safety of U.S. personnel or recipients of U.S. resources; c) When public disclosure would interfere with the agency's ability to effectively discharge its ongoing responsibilities in foreign assistance activities; d) When there are legal constraints on the disclosure of business or proprietary information of non-governmental organizations, contractors, or private sector clients; e) When the laws or regulations of a recipient country apply to a bilateral agreement and restrict access to information; or f) When data reveal private information about individuals that must be kept confidential consistent with ethical guidelines and federal regulations.

When examining information that falls within these categories, USG agencies have sufficient flexibility to protect sensitive information from disclosure, on a case-by-case basis, in order to protect against potential harm while maintaining a strong presumption in favor of transparency. To ensure that these exceptions are rarely applied, and are used appropriately and consistent with the presumption of openness, agencies will maintain specific case-by-case justifications for all instances of reliance on the principled exceptions established in this section. 
","Data and information on U.S. Government ODA flows will be published in IATI format throughout the year on a timely quarterly basis and will be unverified.  This data will be replaced in its entirety at the end of each calendar year with verified, complete statistical OECD/DAC CRS data, once OECD/DAC reporting is complete. As part of its overall data quality control and assurance processes, the U.S. Government will work to identify and resolve discrepancies between preliminary and verified data.  This iterative process will likely result in the publishing of better quality data on a quarterly basis over time.
*Roughly 20% of the records in the CRS generated files have incorrect U.S. Government extending agency names and / or codes.  We are aware of the problem and are actively working to resolve the issue. 
Quarterly activity data will be provided on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Dashboard, maintained by the U.S. State Department and converted to IATI format, and should be considered preliminary.
",US,"By the end of 2012, the U.S. Government   will begin reporting its foreign assistance data in the IATI format.  Data is considered public domain. ","U.S. data published in the IATI format will include information on all U.S. Government foreign assistance flows, not only ODA.  
  
Published budget figures come from the Congressional Budget Justification - a document sent to Congress by the President in January or February of each year, as required by law (31 U.S.C. § 1105), requesting new budget authority for federal programs and estimating federal revenues and outlays for the upcoming fiscal  year and 4 subsequent outyears. Although the title of the document is Budget of the U.S. Government, it represents proposals for congressional consideration. There is not a one-to-one link between budget figures and the financial data - commitments and disbursements - for a given year.  
  
The Congressional Budget Justification includes sectors specific to the U.S. Government.  The budgets have been mapped to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) sector codes in order to improve international usability.

Quarterly activity-level data, for agencies reporting to the Foreign Assistance Dashboard, will be available approximately 60 days after the close of each quarter.  The U.S. Fiscal Year (FY) is 1 October to 30 September, divided into quarters ending 31 December, 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September.  Quarterly reporting is expected to begin in 2013 and will be provided on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Dashboard, maintained by the U.S. State Department and converted to IATI format.

It is an independent Think Tank and a network.
There is now abundant evidence to show that past and current efforts at identifying and implementing solutions that are handed down from outside and are not rooted in the history and culture of Africa have faced some difficulties.
Ownership of these solutions by African countries and populations has repeatedly failed to take root and as the result such solutions have not achieved their full potential and, in some cases, they have done more harm than good.

At continental and country level, ACHEST aspires to strategically promote and advocate for the use of well grounded knowledge and evidence to strengthen professionals and build institutional capacity that will provide transformational leadership to African communities, countries and the world.

ACHEST applies constructive and targeted strategic communication at all levels to catalyze the needed behavior change that will result in stronger ownership and implementation capacity for proven interventions and better health for Africa's people.
To achieve this, ACHEST forges strategic alliances and partnerships with individuals and organizations within Africa and around the world.  It is within this premise that the current partnership in HSA4A is built.

A country with few natural resources, Jordan looks to its human resources as the key element for its success in the markets of the region, and the prosperity, health, and security of its people. Despite the very high enrolment rates and the availability of access to schools across the Kingdom, the quality of education remains uneven. The average achievement in urban areas is higher than that in the rural and more remote areas. One of the major challenges of the Ministry of Education is to provide the schools with the required budget to provide students with a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum learning in all schools across the Kingdom. The schools in remote areas lack sufficient electricity to operate daily services such as providing efficient heating and cooling systems within the classrooms lighting the classrooms, connecting computers and online learning, in extreme temperatures and lack of sufficient financial resources to improve the schools’ environment. A further challenge is, the large influx of Syrian refugees to Jordan, since 2011 has increased the load on the Kingdom’s already limited resources. Key drivers of tension between the hosting communities and the refugees at the micro-level are safeguarding livelihoods and competition for income-generating opportunities; the struggle to find adequate, affordable housing; and challenges in the education sector such as difficulty in accessing education and a deteriorating learning environment. The Syrian crisis has exacerbated long-standing structural challenges in the energy sector in terms of supply, demand and management. Securing a sustainable energy pathway for Jordan is more critical today than ever. As per the latest statistics, electricity consumption in the northern governorates (those mostly affected by the Syrian crisis) showed an additional increase of 2.3 per cent compared to other governorates in Jordan. 

This project aims to contribute to the overall efforts aiming at mitigating the impact of the Syrian crisis in line with the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) focusing on the Northern governorates (Mafraq, Ramtha, Irbid, and North of Balqa’a Governorates) that are most affected by the Syrian crisis. This will be achieved through the use of Renewable Energy (RE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) systems to reduce the growing energy demands improve the learning environment in schools, increase enrollment and retention of Jordanian and Syrian students, improving the livelihood of surrounding communities and promote the social cohesion at the same time. 

Providing the schools with innovative techniques to reduce expenditure in energy bills and generate income will greatly relieve the ministry of the financial burden as well as allowing students, regardless of geographic location and nationality access to a safe and healthy learning environment conducive to maximum academic achievement.

The number of activities excluded in their entirety is negligible.  ,"Our data is extracted from our award/finance management systems each quarter.  As it is taken directly and unaudited, it offers the highest possible level of transparency on our activities.

It is important to publish timely data reflective of the fast-changing nature of Save the Children’s programmes.  This does, however, mean it may differ from the high-quality, audited information that we share through our Annual Report.  For example, our exclusions policy means that the financial information found in our IATI data and Annual Report will not correspond, and for a comprehensive overview the latter document remains the most appropriate source – it is available at: www.savethechildren.org.uk/about-us

When disaster strikes we do whatever it takes to save children’s lives. We work hard to give the poorest children in the UK a better start in life too – both at home and at school. And we challenge global leaders to keep the promises they’ve made to transform the world for children. Save the Children UK is a member of the global Save the Children movement, which is made up of 29 separate national entities. Our international programmes are designed in conjunction with national donors and implemented by Save the Children International.",We currently publish sector information using our own vocabulary,0,"We have provided all information that our systems currently permit as well as other data that we have been able to add within reasonable cost. Publication on certain activities may be pending, subject to official notification of donor permission. 

As above, in our IATI publications an activity is an individual grant or contract, broken down by country or region of implementation. In our internal systems, multi-country grants and contracts are set up as internal ‘funding streams’ with ‘child’ awards for each country. We do this in order to facilitate financial reconciliations between country offices. Due to the way information is held within our systems, ‘parent’ funding streams and their child awards are all published as separate IATI activities, with their relationship indicated using IATI’s ‘related activity’ elements. The parent funding stream IATI activity will not have certain fields/elements (description, sector, recipient-country/region, document-link and records of expenditure). These are published on the child award’s IATI activity file only. In addition, incoming funds may only be recorded against the parent activity (the initial way our systems were set up). In late 2016 we introduced recording of income against the child activity as well (to be phased in across live and new awards). 

Our systems do not easily map against the IATI categories for completion / post-completion, therefore we have adopted ‘implementation’ to cover all award activity (e.g. programme activity may have ended but financial reconciliation, etc. is still ongoing). Therefore in some instances an award status may display as ‘implementation’ even after its planned end date. In December 2017 we published our first set of result for some of our DFID-funded work and will continue to increase the range of activities for which we publish results.",21,"The majority of data is published as a single activities file, not segmented by country or region.

Identifying that food is the best medicine, they believed that developing small-scale agriculture is the key to reducing rural poverty. In 1987, Farm Africa started work with nomadic pastoralists in the remote north of Kenya, expanding to Ethiopia a year later.  

Farm Africa believes that Africa has the power to feed itself and that its smallholders hold the key to lasting rural prosperity. We work directly with farmers to help them unleash their potential to feed Africa’s people.  We pioneer techniques that boost harvests, reduce poverty, sustain natural resources and help end Africa’s need for aid.  

Farm Africa has 200 staff operating across the east African countries of Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.  Farm Africa’s local staff provide the tools and expertise to enable smallholders in eastern Africa to increase their harvests, whether they farm crops, livestock, fish or the forest.  We train them to be more commercial, adding value to surpluses by milling, drying, or turning their produce into products that fetch a higher price.  With better food for their families and reliable incomes from their businesses, farmers can build for the future.

Legal empowerment advocates treat their clients as empowered citizens rather than victims requiring an expert service. Instead of “I will solve this problem for you,” our message is: “We will solve this together, and you will grow stronger in the process.” We track data on every case, and together with our clients we use that information to advocate for systemic changes, like better policies for land governance in Liberia, environmental regulation in India, and healthcare delivery in Mozambique.

INPUD will expose and challenge stigma, discrimination, and the criminalisation of people who use drugs and its impact on the drug-using community’s health and rights. INPUD will achieve this through processes of empowerment and advocacy at the international level, while supporting empowerment and advocacy at community, national and regional levels.

INPUD is a movement of people who use drugs (current and former) who support the Vancouver Declaration. The Vancouver Declaration sets out the demands of people who use drugs, emphasising that their human rights must be respected and their health and wellbeing prioritised. INPUD is a global network that seeks to represent people who use drugs in international agencies such as the United Nations and with those undertaking international development work. We believe that people who use drugs should be meaningfully represented in decision-making processes that affect our lives. INPUD is committed to demonstrating at country level how people who use drugs can constructively contribute to the development and delivery of services for our community. We believe that we have a unique insight that can help money be spent wisely thus delivering better results for individuals and the wider community. We are asking the international community to stop always framing us as the problem and instead to recognise that we are part of the solution when is comes to addressing problems associated with drugs and drug policy around the world.",0,0,0,21,0,notspecified,active,0

The Small Grants Funding Round has been set up to provide funding to smaller NGOs for projects in our 7 priority countries.

In addition, we are currently funding work in Uganda and South Africa through our partnership with Sport Relief and over the last few years we have provided emergency humanitarian funding in response to the crises in Syria, the Philippines, Gaza and West Africa.

  Climate change is increasing the burdens of the poorest people in the world, who are often hardest hit by weather catastrophes, desertification, and rising sea levels, but who have contributed the least to the problem of global warming. In some parts of the world, climate change has already contributed to worsening food security, reduced the predictable availability of fresh water, and exacerbated the spread of disease and other threats to human health. 
 
  Helping the most vulnerable countries and communities is an increasing challenge and imperative for the international community, especially because climate adaptation requires significant resources beyond what is already needed to achieve international development objectives

BNPS has been working for policy reforms at the national level and organizing and mobilizing grassroots people at the community level through a variety of programs.

BNPS follows a bottom-up right-based approach linking community level organized efforts with national level to bring reforms. In this linking process its role is one of the catalysts and facilitators. BNPS has been trying to create a supportive environment for the women, minority and other marginalized groups raising their voice and claiming their entitlements through a list of activities, like critical understanding through development education, institution building, livelihood activities and reforms of different policies, system, institution and mindset. The congenial working environment, culture of co-operation and team work, non-hierarchical management with activist orientation has been recognized by all as an asset of BNPS.

So far BNPS has directly worked with around 200,000 women and for three decades more than 1,000,000 people from different background involved with the initiatives undertaken by BNPS, and it has been recognized as one of the most dynamic women’s organization in Bangladesh. It focuses on social, economical and political empowerment of women, gender equality, strengthening of local government, electoral reform, education reform and gender budget analysis. In addition, BNPS has been taking up many firm steps on many challenging issues like inheritance laws, women representation in power structure i.e. parliament and local government, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR), Prevention of Violent Extremism (PVE), issues of women workers and Violence Against Women and Girls (VAW/G).

BNPS not only have the expertise and wisdom of working with women towards social, economical and political empowerment but also have the activist tenacity to take a political stand in the face of conservative lobbies for the cause of women and human rights. BNPS has been the pioneer in taking up challenging issues against conservative mindsets, which quiver the root of the extremist fundamentalists and their exploitative network.

Vision: A society free from all sorts of discrimination.   

Mission: Equality through empowerment and social transformation.

Objective: To carry out its mission, BNPS is striving to eliminate all sort of discrimination against disadvantaged people particularly women from family to society and state consistent with the principles of the constitution of Bangladesh and all human rights instruments of the United Nations.

Core Values: BNPS has an ideological base with some core values. These are considered as guiding factors that contribute as essential elements in developing all the programs implemented by the organization. The core values of the organization exclusively defined are: • Gender Sensitivity • Secularism • Inclusiveness and • Sustainability with special emphasis on environment",0,0,0,22,0,notspecified,active,0

The mission of the Agência do Zambeze, which was established in 2010, is to promote the socio-economic and sustainable development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. This Basin comprises 34 districts in four provinces: Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezi. In addition to these districts the Agency’s geographical remit also comprise 6 districts that fall outside the River Basin area. 

Following Decree No. 23/2010 of June 2010 the ZVDA is mandated to act in three areas:

•	Undertake studies and present strategies for the socio-economic development of the Lower Zambezi River Basin. 
•	Provide technical and financial assistance to socio-economic development initiatives in the Lower Zambezi River Basin, including mobilizing funds for such initiatives and channelling them to beneficiaries. 
•	Provide support to local governments in local land use planning and socio-economic development

The management of the Agency has taken the strategic decision to facilitate, rather than to implement development projects. By means of national and international tenders, public and private partners are invited to apply to undertake the projects. To a limited extent, ZVDA staff or consultants are charged with project management tasks.

The Agency seeks to play a decisive role in coordinating the relationship between the partners, funders, implementing agencies and beneficiaries. Therefore, information collection and sharing, supervision and monitoring of projects and programmes are key tasks.

A. Al Dabbagh and the Dabbagh Group of companies. The Foundation’s vision is to “improve the lives of disadvantaged children and their communities globally”. This aspiration is realised through a range of initiatives designed to tackle development challenges in some of the poorest countries in the world.  Through a range of approaches, Stars aims to support local actors to address problems they identify by providing access to funding and non-financial support. 
Stars believes that well-run local organisations are best placed to respond to the needs of their communities and the young people in their care. All too often however, they are constrained by a rigid approach to partnerships and funding which can limit their effectiveness. 
Stars’ flagship activity is the annual ‘Impact Awards’ which recognise and reward effective and well-managed local organisations working in the fields of child health, education, protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene). Stars aims to select a winner and runner-up in each field across three regions: Africa-Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Latin America-the Caribbean. The Awards are open to applications from the 100 countries with the highest rates of under-five mortality (http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/apply/eligibility-2/). ",Information on the Stars Impact Awards can be accessed through the following link: http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/impact-awards/ ,0,N/a,60,"Due to the relatively small number of awards provided, IATI data referring to the 'Stars Impact Award' activity is published in one single file which contains aggregated data across countries.",cc-by,active,Data for the Stars Impact Awards will be available within one month of the Impact Award winners being publicly announced.

We are enablers of ecosystem solutions that are transformative to end poverty, marginalisation and create wealth for small-producers and marginalised communities in India and developing nations.   We achieve this through innovation, knowledge and transformative actions, while engaging across grass-root to policy levels. 

We are here as there are number of societal problems, such as poverty and inequity, marginalisation and vulnerability to diseases, disasters, etc., low capabilities and lack of voice of people, and lack of services and opportunities; and these continue to grow.  Solutions exist, but are usually isolated, verticalised and hardly converge to create impact or reach scale.  We, as social entrepreneurs, try our best to facilitate solutions, rather than leaving it to the Government or to the people themselves. 

We strongly believe that ‘Sustainable Livelihood Approach’ can be a great lever to address poverty, marginalisation and inclusive development.  It is very important that these approaches are customised to address different forms of marginalisation, people’s needs, aspirations and the local context.  All our design and work starts with ‘People-First and People at the Centre‘– empathy-led designs distinct from technical/ scientific designs.  

To us, scale is about reach and impact at the community… how depth and width that we have contributed to and for how long these benefits sustain.   Our solutions should therefore be modelled to take us to the scale. We don’t get satisfied with doing it at a few places or with few people.  We therefore ‘model’ our approaches, ‘cost’ them, and ‘integrate’ them to be adopted by communities or market or public policy.

We are passionate about measurement, critiquing ourselves and improve.  We work through result-based planning tools, performance measurement metrics, impact and value for money assessments and use technology where feasible. 

We current reach out to about 310,000 families, which includes farming households, communities that are vulnerable to HIV, communities that are affected with limited access to drinking water, sanitation and disaster affected.   We work through Four Models of livelihood transformation, which are built on different development approaches for different profiles of people - entitlement-focused models to market based models, and hybrid models. 

We work across seven states in India, and work through about 162 community based organisations (such as producer companies/ cooperatives, federations of marginalised groups, etc.)

NewBeginnings stands with a new hope. When Dr. Saraswathi Iyer, HoD of Acharya Nagarjuna University joined in one of our Youth Leaders’ Capacity Building, she said, “NewBeginnings is really a New Beginning for the marginalised”
NCT became a registered ngo on 23rd Nov, 2009. It all started when three of the founding members who have long years of professional experience in social works decided to have a ngo that thinks differently and is bold enough to stand with those who are vulnerable. We deliberately choose target groups who are ignored, live in utter poverty for generations; We choose areas where others don’t usually go. We don’t expect sustainability in our projects. We aim at Chain of Sustainable Impact in our projects. What we mean by CSI – the beneficiary of a project should become a benefactor to her/his own neighbour. A trained youth of our project should train another youth in the same vocational skill; a child who is sponsored right now for her education should promise that she would educate another poor child when she is able to earn; a women group which has been trained in how to counsel and avoid domestic violence should talk to women in their neighbourhoods. Thus, we multiply the grant we receive from our donors. 
At the heart of our mission is transparency. A well-organized Management Structure headed by the Governing Body and is well connected to the stakeholders of our programmes.
NewBeginnings has a clearly written down policies and System in place. Be sure, you will be working with a professionally managed organisation: A clearly written down Management policies, Staff polices, Finance Polices, Volunteers’ Policies and Networking Policies etc guide us in our daily work.
Where there is no hope, we begin to give hope; where people feel that they have come to a dead-end, we want to start again. NewBeginnings gives a New Beginning in every heart; show them a way to live. Life it to the full.  ","- Data is pertained to only the target area/ group
